Documentation File

My platform had 4 pages
	- The home page which has a header and a footer and a welcome message for the users
	- The service page which list and describes our services
	- The contact page which lets the user know they can reach us via email
	- The order page which allows the user to order pillows, mirrors and blankets in specified quantities and calculates the cost for the user.


How I Adapted The Code
  - I adapted the code by changing the company name for the page and order form codes, and also for all the other pages
  - I also used my own custom colors and aligned the logo center
  - Also, for the order form I changed the names of the products and the respective prices
  - I made my own simple php code for the contact form
  - The order form let's the user enter his or her address and also outputs the time of the transaction
  - Exceptions are used to account for errors


Challenges
  - I had an undefined function error for the each() function
  - I also had undefined array errors for the products
